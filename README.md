# KataTracks
The KataTracks system is three parts: The KataTracks software, the LightSuit, and the LightSuitAngel device.

The KataTracks Application provides remote Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) control over multiple LightSuits.

Each LightSuit is a series of individually controlled addressable LED strips and LightSuitAngel. Velcro strips are attached to clothing, then to led strips. The velcro holds the strips together and connect at ends through 3-wire BTF connectors into the LightSuitAngel.

The LightSuitAngel devices provides 8-channels of control of LightSuit control. A 3d-printed case covers an Arduino Nano BLE device, using NeoPixel to run micro-second timed preprogrammed tracks.

Other simpler 1-channel devices can also be used with BTF splitters.
