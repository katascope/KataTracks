## KataTracks
The KataTracks Application provides remote Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) control over multiple LightSuits.

## LightSuit
Each LightSuit is a series of individually controlled addressable LED strips and LightSuitAngel. Velcro strips are attached to clothing, then to led strips. The velcro holds the strips together and connect at ends through 3-wire BTF connectors into the LightSuitAngel.

## LightSuitAngel
The LightSuitAngel devices provides 8-channels of control of LightSuit control. A 3d-printed case covers an Arduino Nano BLE device, using NeoPixel to run micro-second timed preprogrammed tracks.
