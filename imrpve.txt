front of pants?
spins look really good
practice flexing body like bow
on each red line in, have it inverted for eva
make each part of the routine more color coded by section
in back to back and lean, use the parallel alignment
less waiting on eva, more leading
eva could go dark before lift then explode out like a bomb
do horizontal change flicker when we do back to back rotates before lean
